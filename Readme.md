Welcome to StackEdit!
===================


Hey! I'm your first Markdown document in **StackEdit**[^stackedit]. Don't delete me, I'm very helpful! I can be recovered anyway in the **Utils** tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

StackEdit stores your documents in your browser, which means all your documents are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**

> **Note:**

> - StackEdit is accessible offline after the application has been loaded for the first time.
> - Your local documents are not shared between different browsers or computers.
> - Clearing your browser's data may **delete all your local documents!** Make sure your documents are synchronized with **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** (check out the [<i class="icon-refresh"></i> Synchronization](#synchronization) section).

#### <i class="icon-folder-open"></i> Switch to another document

All your local documents are listed in the document panel. You can switch from one to another by clicking a document in the list or you can toggle documents using <kbd>Ctrl+[</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+]</kbd>.
